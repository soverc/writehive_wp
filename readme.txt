The WriteHive WP plugin allows for passionate writers and publishers to leverage syndication.

== Description ==

Syndicate all your existing posts and new posts with a click of the mouse.  Your content is submitted centrally for access to publishers around the world who can publish your content as easily as you submitted it.  You set the terms of use and the publisher accepts them - including payment if you want to get paid.
 
 
WriteHive syndicated articles are not editable, title and tags can be modified, but the body of the article is not editable.  

The WriteHive WP plugin is focused on stability of features. We will soon be rolling out aggregated comments, search enhancements for content and  most importantly your feedback will result in changes. Let us know what you do or don't like and what you might like to see in the future.
